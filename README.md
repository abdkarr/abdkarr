### About Me
Hello there! I am a post-doctoral research associate at the department of ECE at Michigan State University. My research interest is various graph related machine learning problems. 

### Research Interests
I have been working/worked on different projects related to learning from graphs, which led to different Github repos. Below is a categorization of these projects based on their respective research problem:

- [Graph Learning](https://github.com/stars/abdkarr/lists/graph-learning): Projects on inference of graph structure from observed graph signals.
- [Community Detection](https://github.com/stars/abdkarr/lists/community-detection): Projects on detection of community structure from graphs.
- [Robust Learning on Graphs](https://github.com/stars/abdkarr/lists/robust-gsp): *Under Construction*
- [Crowdsourcing](https://github.com/stars/abdkarr/lists/crowdsourcing): *Under Construction*
